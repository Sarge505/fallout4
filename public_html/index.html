    <h1>Welcome to Fallout 4</h1>
    <p>Fallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic Boston in the year 2287, 210 years after a devastating nuclear war, in which the player character emerges from an underground bunker known as a Vault. Gameplay is similar to Fallout 3. Completing quests and acquiring experience levels up the character, allowing for new abilities. With an optional first- or third-person view, players can explore Fallout 4‍ '​s open world setting at will, allowing nonlinear gameplay. Additional party members can accompany the player, who are able to assist them in battles. Players have the ability to construct and deconstruct buildings and items, and use them to build a settlement, which can attract and be inhabited by non-playable characters. </p>
    <h2>So... What Is Cool About Fallout 4?</h2>
    <p>From the RPG elements down to the environment, with a few additional new features to boot, this is largely what you've been expecting. It's hardly a spoiler to reveal that you're going to spend 99% of the game in the post-nuclear apocalyptic Wasteland (the pre-bomb sequence is a surprisingly short part of the game), and anybody who's played a Fallout game before will be in their element; when Bethesda says "Welcome home", it really means it.
That said, you'll be exploring new terrain: Fallout plonks you in the Commonwealth, aka post-war Massachusetts, as familiarly war-ravaged and dangerous as its neighbouring territories in Fallout 3. There's still an ever-present sense of threat as you wander, and you'll be challenged by tough enemies from the off. There are new enemies, but new ways to deal with them, be it weapons or skills. For example, this time the Animal Friend perk will let you befriend a Deathclaw. Yes, really.
There's also an ever-present feeling that things are happening out there which you're completely uninvolved with. Be it Skyrim or Fallout, Bethesda's tried to make its world appear alive and busy in spite of you, and in Fallout 4 you'll stumble into many events that appear unscripted. Sometimes it will be a firefight between two warring factions, and how you choose to deal with it is up to you.
There were times we died and returned to find that going through the same motions didn't trigger the same event, be it getting caught in some crossfire or having a mutant charging at us from out of the darkness. The Wasteland is at its best when it's at its least predictable and creating those anecdotes that make you feel like your time with the game is unlike anyone else's.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest - if not THE biggest - new feature of Fallout 4 is the new crafting system. It's massive, and will be a big part of your time with the game from start to finish. Items scattered around the wasteland can be salvaged and broken down to materials than you can then use to build weapons, armour modifications, furniture and base defences.

    <h2>Fallout Difference from Real Timeline</h2>
    <p>Note that the Fallout world is not our own, but rather one that has diverged from ours soon after World War II. So, while it takes place in the future, it is not our future, but a future as imagined in traditional 1950s style science fiction. Note that the timeline is only for the chronological sequence of the Fallout world events.</p>
    <p>Although the Fallout universe and the real world share a common timeline until about 1945, the defining moment of the Fallout universe was the Great War of 2077. On October 23, 2077, the United States, China, and other nuclear-armed countries commenced a brief but rapid exchange of nuclear strikes. Although the conflict lasted only two hours, the destruction it brought was staggering and complete: more energy was released in the early moments of the war than in all previous global conflicts combined.</p>
