    <h2> And Get yourself a Copy</h2>
	<p>Setting and story
During Bethesda's E3 conference, it was revealed that the player will be the Sole Survivor of Vault 111, who emerges approximately 210 years after the Great War. Prior to this, the player is shown to have lived during the pre-War era with their spouse and child.
The setting was confirmed to take place in Boston, Massachusetts, from the trailer released on June 3, 2015. The trailer shows the Paul Revere Monument, the USS Constitution, as well as the Massachusetts State House with its unique Golden Dome. Scollay Square, Bunker Hill memorial, and Fenway Park are also visible in the trailer. Areas within Fenway Park include (from left to right) Swatters Custom Baseball Store, Diamond City Surplus, Power Noodles, and Chem-I-Care. Fenway Park is renamed Diamond City, as seen in the surplus store name, and the white diamond symbol seen on the outside of the building and on the Diamond City Surplus store. The events of Fallout 4 occur in 2287; a decade after Fallout 3, and six years after Fallout: New Vegas.
Vault 111 is in the North-West corner of the map as it was seen in the trailer. Furthermore, the Sole Survivor wearing the Vault 111 jumpsuit is carrying a laser musket, can be seen meeting Dogmeat and starting on a road leading away from the camera, a motif seen in various previous installments.
Vault 111 is also near Sanctuary Hills, the estate where the Sole Survivor is from. According to the game trailer, it seems to be the first place most players may encounter (provided they don't go the other way). The player's robot, Codsworth, still resides there. Going by the E3 reveal, one of the player-built settlement sites is in Sanctuary Hills, the player's original neighborhood before the war.
The setting will also include mountains and the out-lands of Boston's city limits.
The game will feature just over 111,000 lines of dialogue, more than all of the dialogue in Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim combined.
Gameplay
The gameplay is largely similar to that of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, with the ability to switch from first to third person view. Additional features are a split-piece armor system, base-building, a dynamic dialogue system, in depth crafting system which implements every lootable object in the game, and much more. Enemies such as mole rats, raiders, super mutants, deathclaws, and ghouls will also return to the series.
The player character, the Sole Survivor, obtains a Pip-Boy which allows the player to access a menu with statistics, maps, data, and items. Players can also find game cartridges, which can be played on the Pip-Boy. Another returning gameplay feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), which plays an important part in combat. While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed down, and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of "bullet time". Various actions cost action points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a turn, and the player can target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries; head shots can be used for quick kills or blinding, legs can be targeted to slow enemies' movements, and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons.
A new feature to the series is the ability to build settlements and buildings. Players can select and scrap objects and structures for resources and building supplies, and use them to build their own structures ranging from fully-decoratable houses, towers, bars, labs, and more. The player can also construct more than one settlement across the Commonweatlh, and can send brahmin caravans between their towns. Towns can be powered with working electricity, using a dynamic power line system, as well as equipped water pumps and crops/gardens to keep a steady income of food and drink. Merchants and non-player characters can inhabit player towns and help keep the settlements running as a community. Players can build various defenses around their settlements, such as turrets, guard towers, and traps, to defend the settlements, as they can be raided and attacked.
Another new feature to Fallout that was confirmed by Bethesda Studios on Twitter is that there is no level cap, allowing players to experience a little more freedom when it comes to exploring and combat. Another confirmed feature that allows even more explorational freedom is that, also confirmed by Bethesda's Twitter, is that even if the game 'ends' you may continue playing, a feature returning from Broken Steel, which allows players to experience the aftermath of their decisions. In addition, a new weapon system will allow a wide variety of customization.
DevelopmentInitially, in 2004, Bethesda Softworks licensed from Interplay Entertainment the rights to create and publish three Fallout games (Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4). Later, in 2007, Bethesda purchased the entire franchise, and Interplay licensed back from Bethesda the rights to a Fallout MMORPG. The legal dispute is now over, with Bethesda Softworks and its in-house development studio retaining the rights to all of the Fallout franchise, including an MMO.
In 2008, Bethesda's Pete Hines said: "The whole reason we went out and acquired the license and that we now own Fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one." He also added: "This is not something we're going to do once and then go away and never do it again. When that will be or how long that will be God only knows, but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with The Elder Scrolls."
Development began right after Fallout 3 's release, in 2009. The game had minor development due to Skyrim being developed at the same time. After Skyrim was released in 2011, Fallout 4 became the primary project for Bethesda.

Mod support
Fallout 4 is the first Fallout game to have native mod support for consoles. During the E3 2015, at the Xbox Conference, Todd Howard went on stage to tell the audience that Xbox One will offer mod support. Sony's PlayStation 4 will support mods sometime in the future.
Downloadable content
Bethesda has confirmed  there is DLC coming starting early 2016, as well as smaller updates along the same lines as Skyrim has seen. Bethesda will also be selling a Season Pass for all add-ons, at a price of $30 USD.

Fallout 4's launch was a huge success. Bethesda announced today that the game shipped 12 million copies worldwide for launch day alone, "representing sales in excess of $750 million." In addition, the game is generating "record sales" at brick and mortar stores and across Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, andPC.
Bethesda did not say how many of those 12 million copies shipped to retailers were actually sold through to consumers. The $750 million number likely represents the total possible revenue, if indeed all 12 million were actually sold. We've contacted Bethesda in an attempt to learn more about Fallout 4's performance.
"Major retailers have informed Bethesda of the tremendous consumer interest in Fallout 4 , with some noting it was the most pre-ordered game this year," Bethesda added, noting that the Pip-Boy Edition became the fastest-selling collector's edition for any game in history "at leading retailers."<p>
